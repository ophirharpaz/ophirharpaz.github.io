It was two months ago when I was asked to join BlueHat IL's review board.
I thought the org-team called to ask me to submit a talk, and was extremely flattered when I realized 
they wanted me to review others'.
[BlueHat IL](https://www.bluehatil.com) is definitely one of my favorite information security conferences :)

The review process took place in the busiest month possible. I spoke together with 
[Daniel](https://twitter.com/ace__pace) in various conferences (Hackfest, DeepSec and Botconf) and taught 
a threat hunting workshop in my community, [Baot](https://www.extend-tech.com/baot). This was a stressful
period, and I had to make sure my time was efficiently used.

There were many dozens of submissions to BlueHat IL. Reading and reviewing all of them, 
I detected which patterns made the reviewing process easier for me, and which behaviours drove me nuts.

I'm certain there are online recommendations for writing good abstracts and preparing quality submissions, 
but I decided to give my two cents as a checklist which anyone can quickly go through when applying for a 
CFP. To the list!


## _DOs_


:heavy_check_mark: <b><u>Do state what's new<u><b>

No conference looks for plain overviews. Known techniques, previously talked-about
approaches, existing tools - these rarely get more interesting when you group them together in 
one slide deck. If you think that's the case, make sure you explain why this overview has a real added value.

:heavy_check_mark: <b><u>Do introduce the topic<u><b>

Many of the BlueHat submissions dealt with topics I was not familiar with. It was always pleasant 
to be introduced to the basics at the beginning of the abstract. Of course, you should not
explain the term "internet", but make sure you introduce even basic terms in your field of expertise
and not leave any nontrivial acronyms unexplained.


:heavy_check_mark: <b><u>Do double check your English<u><b>

Seriously, why do people still submit without cross-checking? If you don't have a native English speaker 
friend, pay someone $5 on Fiverr and have a native speaker review your text. I find submissions
with language mistakes extremely distracting, and it's difficult for me to focus on the actual message
when it's surrounded with typos, grammar mistakes and incorrect punctuation.


:heavy_check_mark: <b><u>Do signal that you're prepared<u><b>

If the application has fields you can provide, such as talk outline, slide deck draft, 
links to your previous talks, etc. - don't hesitate to fill those in. They make your submission stand out
and give the review board the confidence that your talk will be under control.


:heavy_check_mark: <b><u>Do assume others provided all optional fields<u><b>

You won't necessarily have prepared slides or a YouTube link to an amazing
appearance of yours. However, keep in mind that others may have them in their submission. 
Therefore, try maximizing the quality of what you _do_ have (e.g. if you only provide 
an abstract, make sure it's extensive enough). Perfect the parts of the submission you have.


## _DON'Ts_

:x: <b><u>Don't submit redundant attachments<u><b>

Attachments are a wonderful tool to extend your submission and show what you've got. Yet, if the PDF you
attached tells us exactly what the application form did - refrain from using it. 
It takes the reviewer two minutes to download a file and find out it is completely unnecessary - 
two minutes too many.

:x: <b><u>Don't recycle names<u><b>

I bumped into a CFP named almost identically as the author's previous presentation. I read the
name, wondered _"Hmm this looks familiar"_ and found a similar talk title (from the same speaker)
in a conference agenda from last year.

Your research is diverse, your projects vary. Name them differently.

:x: <b><u>Don't write a 2-sentences-abstract, even if you're a "Big Shot"<u><b>

Need I really explain? The fact you're famous and renowned does not make me prefer your talk over
the rest. Especially if it has ten times less content. Arrogance does not give you an advantage.

:x: <b><u>Don't submit 8 talks<u><b>

Yes, you read that right. No, they were not different. 

I don't care how much you have to say. Never, ever, ever, submit 8 talks to a conference.

I know very few people do this, but if I manage to prevent even one from doing so - I will save someone's 
valuable time, so it is worth it :smirk:

:x: <b><u>Don't leave stupid sentences in your submission<u><b>

Here is an example of a so-called academic research paper we got. Around the
middle of it, there was this mind-blowing piece of poetry:

![Authors leave weird sentences in their attachments](/images/too_much_work.png "Registry Writes to MRU Keys")

I think the idea is clear.

Oh, and good luck :)
