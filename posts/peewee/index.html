      <p>This is a story about problem solving. True, it involves Python and database code, but eventually what I&rsquo;m describing
is running into a problem, understanding its root cause and finding a creative way to solve it.</p>
<p>To understand this blog post, all you need to know is some SQL. I&rsquo;ll try to take care of the rest.</p>
<h3 id="entities--schema">Entities &amp; Schema</h3>
<p>For the sake of simplicity, we&rsquo;ll be talking about <em>Books</em> and <em>Authors</em>.
The relation between them is <em>many-to-many</em>: a book may have more than one author, and an author can write more than
one book.</p>
<p>The data is stored in a <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a> database in 3 tables: <em>Book</em>, <em>Author</em>, and
<em>BookToAuthor</em>. Each entity (book and author) has an ID, and the last table simply maps between these IDs.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th align="center">book_id</th>
<th align="center">author_id</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td align="center">1</td>
<td align="center">3</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center">2</td>
<td align="center">9</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center">3</td>
<td align="center">6</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center">3</td>
<td align="center">9</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The database code is written in <a href="http://docs.peewee-orm.com/en/latest/">Peewee</a>.
Peewee is an ORM library in Python, which means it converts data from certain SQL databases (PostgreSQL is among them)
to Python objects and vice versa.
When you query the database, you do it by writing object-oriented code instead of raw SQL statements.</p>
<h3 id="the-task">The Task</h3>
<p>The task I had to perform was simple: <strong>find all books that were written by a specific list of authors</strong>,
e.g. find all books whose authors are Jane Austen, J.K. Rowling and Harper Lee (all three!).</p>
<p>To do that, I performed a two-level query:</p>
<ol>
<li>First, for each book ID, aggregate all its author IDs into an array (as seen in the table below).</li>
<li>Then, return only the books whose aggregated array equals the given array.</li>
</ol>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th align="center">book_id</th>
<th align="center">author_ids</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td align="center">1</td>
<td align="center">[3]</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center">2</td>
<td align="center">[9]</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center">3</td>
<td align="center">[6, 9]</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>This was my code for the first step:</p>

<li><code>contains</code> is a Peewee <a href="http://docs.peewee-orm.com/en/latest/peewee/playhouse.html#ArrayField.contains">method</a>

</code></pre></div><p><strong>Peewee was using <code>ILIKE</code> <em>string</em> operator. It was not treating <code>author_ids</code> as an array</strong>.</p>
<p>Using Peewee&rsquo;s <code>.sql()</code> method, I could confirm this by seeing the full query to which my code was translated:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-sql" data-lang="sql"><span style="color:#66d9ef">SELECT</span> t1.book_id

</code></pre></div><p>It was time to see why Peewee chose a string operator - a case-insensitive string match - instead of array-contains.</p>
<h3 id="debugging">Debugging</h3>
<p>With Pycharm I did a lot of F7 and F8 to step into and over the code.
Eventually I broke on the following method inside the <code>ColumnBase</code> class:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="color:#66d9ef">def</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">contains</span>(self, rhs):
    <span style="color:#66d9ef">return</span> Expression(self, <span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;ILIKE&#39;</span>, <span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;</span><span style="color:#e6db74">%%%s%%</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;</span> <span style="color:#f92672">%</span> rhs)
</code></pre></div><p>Peewee reached a place I didn&rsquo;t want it to reach - a class for generic column types. In this class, the method
<code>contains</code> treats its operands as strings.</p>
<p>However, Peewee has a more specific class
named <code>ArrayField</code>. There, there&rsquo;s a different implementation for the method <code>contains</code> which is mapped onto a different
SQL operator:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="color:#66d9ef">def</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">contains</span>(self, <span style="color:#f92672">*</span>items):
    <span style="color:#66d9ef">return</span> Expression(self, <span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;@&gt;&#39;</span>, ArrayValue(self, items))
</code></pre></div><p>This was exactly what I needed - the <code>@&gt;</code> operator which checks if an array contains one or more of another array&rsquo;s
elements. But Peewee never got there :(</p>
<p>I needed to find a way to override this behavior and tell Peewee that the two operands are arrays, and that <code>contains</code>
should be translated into <code>@&gt;</code> and not into <code>ILIKE</code><!-- raw HTML omitted -->1<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<h3 id="using-peewees-_expression_">Using Peewee&rsquo;s <em>Expression</em></h3>
<p>Peewee allows adding custom expressions. An expression consists of a left-hand and right-hand side operands and an
operator.</p>
<p>For example, the last <code>contain</code> method called an expression which used <code>ArrayField</code> values as both operands, and
the operator <code>@&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>And so I added my new, custom expression inside a function:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="color:#66d9ef">def</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">array_equals</span>(lhs, rhs):
    <span style="color:#66d9ef">return</span> Expression(lhs, <span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;@&gt;&#39;</span>, rhs)
</code></pre></div><p>Good! My new query looked like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="color:#75715e"># First-Level Query (same as before)</span>

</code></pre></div><p>Look at the query though - the operator changed! Peewee was now building my query with the array-contains operator <code>@&gt;</code>,
which was a huge step in the process of solving this issue.</p>
<p>However, as the error indicated - something remained incorrect with the arguments&rsquo; types. Since the <code>author_ids</code>
operand was seen as an integer array (see the first line in the error message), it must have been the right-hand side
operand - the list literal - that was incorrectly parsed.</p>
<h3 id="one-last-trick">One Last Trick</h3>
<p>Looking at the examples in the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/functions-array.html">PostgreSQL documentation</a>, I saw
that array operations were done with explicit type declaration - arrays are preceded with the keyword <code>ARRAY</code>.</p>
<p>Completely impatient but with a strong feeling of almost-victory, I replaced the python variable with a pure SQL
expression:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="color:#75715e"># Only the relevant line-of-code from before...</span>
array_equals(subquery<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>c<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>author_ids, SQL(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;ARRAY{}&#39;</span><span style="color:#f92672">.</span>format(certain_authors)))
</code></pre></div><p>This was a hacky solution, but it produced my oh-so-desired SQL query:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-sql" data-lang="sql"><span style="color:#66d9ef">SELECT</span> t1.book_id

<h3 id="lessons-learned">Lessons Learned</h3>
<p>This extremely-specific scenario had important takeaways for me to recall in the future:</p>
<ol>
<li>Don&rsquo;t be afraid to debug library code. We often use it as a black box, but in cases like mine it was important
to dig in and confirm where the problem lay.</li>
<li>The idea of using <code>Expressions</code> was my colleague&rsquo;s - Tal Shahnovsky.
When things don&rsquo;t work, I personally tend to get frustrated and think &ldquo;Nothing will ever solve this&rdquo;.
Someone else&rsquo;s clear mind may bring some good ideas into the process, give them a chance.</li>
<li>A better knowledge of Peewee would have helped me in coming up with <code>Expression</code> as a solution. If you&rsquo;re working with
a library and having trouble - invest some time in getting to know the module and its capabilities better.
This may pay off.</li>
</ol>
<p>If any of you have an idea of how to solve this problem better, more elegantly or just differently,
I&rsquo;ll be pleased to hear from you.
Do not hesitate to contact.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<hr>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->1<!-- raw HTML omitted -->You may think to yourself: &ldquo;Why not just execute a raw SQL query?&quot;. mat
Peewee indeed has this functionality - build a query using a string and execute it with <code>execute_sql</code>.
However, the resulting rows are returned as tuples and not as objects, which would make my code ugly AF.
But this was what I intended to do as a last resort.</p>

"why":"There's nothing I hate more than not knowing how a problem was solved. Also, once it's solved, the thing I want least is to reproduce the not-working situation. I hate computers.",
"longer":"I thought exploiting #sudo with CVE-2019-18634 will take... days. This side project took me weeks, 2500 words of research notes, DMs to folks who did this before (thank you), frustration, and tons of new knowledge. I think I understand now every bit of it. So it was worth it.",
"sucked":"I'm experiencing impostor syndrome on behalf of the malware I'm working on.",
"malware research":"I've been tweeting a lot lately about this Linux malware written in Golang, which was fascinating for me to reverse engineer and debug. So it's finally time to meet #FritzFrog - a #P2P botnet with a worm malware spreading over SSH. >>",
"wrong":"I really wanted to brag on how I detached an EBS from its EC2 instance, then attached it to another, mounted it, fixed the sudoers file I had completely messed up to begin with, unmounted the EBS and attached it back to the original EC2. But it totally failed, so no brag today.",
"weak spots":"#FrustrationThread I'm working on a terrific series of reversing challenges which I'll write on once I'm done. With the last couple of challenges, I reversed them well,  understood everything on the assembly level and could describe the flow too. But it's just not enough. [1/3]",
"know everything":"How emotional I am from 0 to crying because I realize I don't have time to read all the books I want to read.",
"because":"I'm frustrated af :(",
"hit me":"I really need this downgrading voice out of my head. Now.",
"proud of myself":"I just DMed someone 'Hey. I'm completely in love with your blog post on sudo pwfeedback exploitation' and asked for a Zoom meeting to discuss it. I feel like a pervert.",
"guts":"One day I'll be courageous enough to join this coffee club. And @Dafna_Mordechai I'm taking you with me.",
"compilers meetup":"",
"dread":"Even a Zoom talk makes me shit my pants. Plans for tonight when I'm done with it: wine and pcaps.",
"take a break":"My piano teacher once instructed me to hang an A4 paper on my wall and write on it 'Fake it until you make it'. This was the phrase I saw in front of my eyes during hours of daily practice. I faked it for a long time and I even think I made it, eventually, in a way :) 1/4",
"fuck that":"So what if I wanted to record a short video on how to solve something on @awscloud and they published the exact solution on their knowledge center like 3 weeks ago. I'm doing it anyway. Mine is more fun.",
"productive week":"They say it's good to acknowledge your success too, so, I did well this week :) I was organized, curious, pedantic. I was loyal to my values. Got rest when I needed it. I'm grateful for the people I work with and the type of tasks I'm assigned. Have a great weekend y'all",
"cronjobs":"Ophir, next time you add a #cronjob, remember: * Working directory will by home directory * Concatenate shell commands with && not ; * Job's not working? log by adding '> output.log 2>&1' * SUPER IMPORTANT: In vi editor, :w does not install jobs Disappointed face You gotta :wq #NoteToSelf",
"cutest word":"You've never written a cooler commit message than the one I just wrote and which contained the word 'cronjobable'",
"typedef":"This short post on C typedef and const is the cutest thing I read today. I just love C peculiarities :)",
"assembly":"TIL that shift instructions store the pushed bits into the carry flag. This allows, for example, to efficiently check the parity of a number before it's shifted right by one bit; if it was an odd number, the carry flag will be set and we can branch accordingly with, say, JNC.",
"hardware":"I just broke an SSD nand chip. Honestly, I can't believe this tiny piece of material stores data. Hardware adventures with @ace__pace", 
"switch":"TIL how switch statements are handled by the compiler (well, one way). The compiler generates a table of value-label pairs - possible values the expression we 'switch on' can take, and labels to jump to, accordingly. [1/3] @Dafna_Mordechai",
"assignment":"TIL with @Dafna_Mordechai  Crown that (a=b)=c compiles in C++ but not in C. That's because in C, a=b returns the value of b (which can't be assigned anything), whereas in C++, a=b returns a reference to a (an 'l-value') - which can be used in the second assignment. #trivia",
"WiFi on a plane":"The most important URL I will ever memorize is http://msftconnect.com. This way, even if my stupid phone doesn't auto-launch the browser to connect to the WiFi, I can open it myself.",
"phrasing":"Nothing demotivates me more than a badly-phrased research question. I find it extremely important to state my tasks in a clear, non-ambiguous way.",
"layout":"Sometimes, quite weirdly, the layout has tremendous effect. I once had a task-list on Google docs which felt *completely different* and more thrilling once converted into a Google sheet. I can't explain it, that's just what it was :)",
"crucial":"#NoteToSelf If something works and you're just too happy to write down what you did to make it work - write down what you did to make it work.",
"unexpected domains":"It's nice how a task such as 'write an IDAPython script that does this and that' leads me to learn how to automatically launch ssh-agent on Git Bash. Technology branches in fun directions :)",
"less you know":"LMAO. the .md extension in gcc code stands for machine description. I thought it was markdown. FML.",
"new things":"Thanks to this Linux malware I'm analyzing now, I've finally become good friends with strace and its flags. Before, I was practically avoiding it. Now I use it all the time and consider it a powerful tool. Unfamiliar tasks bring knowledge but also expand your arsenal. Feels good.",
"never imagined":"Understanding this tweet was the best moment of my day. Sincerely yours, the person who never quite understood Public Key Infrastructure.",
"new enthusiasm":"a year ago: reading compiler code to fall asleep. today: can't fall asleep because of compiler code",
"IDAPython":"Wrote my second #IDAPython script Woman dancing It renames functions that contain Linux syscalls (INT 80h) according to IDA's auto-generated comments. Simple, but was really fun to write :) Thanks @tmr232 for showing me the more elegant & efficient ways to do things.",
"scripts":"Suppose you're interested in triggering a function inside a DLL, how do you figure out which exports lead to calling it? My new #Sark & #IDAPython script lets you see all call-flows starting in an exported function and ending in your function of choice.",
"contributed":"Just merged my second PR to @Guardicore 's  #InfectionMonkey! Now the monkey knows how to exploit vulnerable @drupal servers using CVE-2019-6340! You're curious about what I learned, right? Ok ok, here are some things as well as how long the struggle with them took.",
"harder":"You play a CTF, fight with the stack to trigger a buffer overflow, you get the flag. Then comes @ace__pace and challenges you to get the flag _and_ exit cleanly. So you're shaping payloads until ~2AM when you find out you finally managed to get rid of the segfault Grinning face with smiling eyes Good night.",
"4-women hackathon":"Weekend #hackathon: Technologies I learned about: @heroku, #Flask, @sqlalchemy (Woman facepalming), @Firebase, #Alembic & more. I got to plan, design, setup, develop, push, configure, (auto-)deploy, migrate and debug. a lot. I think it's alcohol time now.",
"enjoyed":"I did some front end today *and* enjoyed it. I surprise myself",
"motherboards":"It took a whole Friday morning and around 10 online quizzes but I can now identify pretty well most of the important ports and slots on a motherboard. Ugh, computers are beautiful.",
"computers":"The two highlights of my day (technically speaking): 1. Managing to print the debug logs of quite a sophisticated Linux malware sample 2. Understanding what NB_HS (see picture) stands for without needing to Google it. and yours?",
"applied":"",
"Friday nights":"I just created the most beautiful diagram showing the connections between netvsc, vmbus and ndis drivers & how a vmbus channel is passed via different structures and functions between them. I'm dying to send this to certain people but it's Friday night and shame defeats me.",
"minor things":"It took me three days to perform DH key exchange with a malware sample. Three days, and it was all about the base-64 implementation in use. Mine was not URL-safe (had + and /), and the malware's - the other (used - and _ instead). One step at a time. Eventually I'll break it.",
"success":"I've had about a week of grumpiness, struggling with the malware's encrypted communications. Today I finally managed to talk to it, end-to-end, bidrectionally. *In Go*, ffs.",
"fun":"Here's how a single ampersand killed an hour of my life. I was experimenting with an RCE on Drupal (CVE-2019-6340) for the #InfectionMonkey. The output of the remotely-executed command returns right after the HTTP response, making it hard to distinguish between the two.",
"care about":"I don't know how exciting this will be for anyone who's not me but TBH I don't care. I wanted to place breakpoints on all the functions which are triggered by CNC commands. Luckily, they're all called from the same function so I wrote an IDA script to fetch all xrefs from it. >>",
"ascii art":"",
"not being able to sleep":"and tonight at 'Ophir has trouble sleeping': I just googled 'How was the first compiler compiled' and learned that compiler bootstrapping is a (cool) thing. Did it help me fall asleep? The opposite, of course.",
"Twice":"After contemplating 'what compiles the compiler', tonight at our show 'Ophir's having trouble sleeping': who schedules the scheduler? @MatalonMor",
"burned out":"I  have absolutely no energy to work on self progress lately. All I do in my free time is reading Dostoevsky, (attempting at) playing chess and drinking hot chocolate on the sofa. A different type of side projects.",
"COVID":"How come that with so much less distraction and much more time in front of my PC, I'm not getting even near working on my side projects. This shit is challenging. Things are more async, no door to knock on for quick answers. So much screen time. Definitely a new muscle to build.",
"personal difficulties":"I'm afraid that the things I really want to improve at, are often those which I run away from. The problem is, it's a vicious circle; so as long as I avoid doing X, I won't improve at X, which will make me want to be good at X, and so on... I wonder if someone can relate to that.",
"keep on going":"A couple of days ago, I started reading a dull protocol specification. With quite a lot of effort I managed to read about half of it, and understood even less. Still, quite interestingly, it had a great effect on how comfortable I feel with my research target. [1/2]",
"explode":"I have this impulse of strong, almost uncontrollable motivation. I believe these moments of ambition are important to drive one forward. They serve as accumulators of energy, which you can use to learn and progress. Use this energy to make a change. To do good. Good night.",
"leave":"<offtopic> I'm starting to need more fingers to count the people who suddenly and silently pushed me out of their lives. I always try to understand why, but usually they won't tell me. This lack of feedback prevents me from improving and makes it hard to even apologize.",
"Baot":"",
"intense":"Learning compilers with @Dafna_Mordechai be like: Solving an exercise, finding a problem, disagreeing on the analysis, raising our voices, screaming at each other, eventually finding our mistake, concluding with 'ok so we were both right'. I love my friends ♥",
"fun":"Geeking out is, say, reading the sentence 'Since information from declarations is incorporated into the symbol table, they are not needed in the syntax tree' and going 'wooooaaaah this is so cool!' Compiler adventures with @Dafna_Mordechai",
"how to talk":"Me: I found the most amazing vegan dessert recipe! @Dafna_Mordechai: Awesome, do you have a preprocessor to prepare it with? Me: You mean food processor, you compiler-obsessed geek?",
"original plans":"Plans before talking to @Dafna_Mordechai: listen to a talk about SECOPS, debug malware, read a chapter about packet analysis, reverse something. Plans after talking to @Dafna_Mordechai: create a GIF showing how compilers do unification of type expressions",
"useless GIFs":"I totally just created a gif that will serve myself and my study-partner and no one else. Oh well",
"talking":"'Life begins at the end of your comfort zone'. Giving talks in public conferences is scary, but it's a major career progress. Yesterday, 40 @Baot_IL members wrote their first abstracts and I was there to witness. Will 2020 have more tech female speakers on stage? Yes, I think so.",
"drinking":"Conversations at @Guardicore be like",
"buddies":"This is exactly how this week should end. Mixin it at @Guardicore", 
"tempt":"Romantic is when your TL invites you to a binary exploitation remote session. @liadmord #JustKidding #WeAreBothKindaMarried",
"obsessed":"I feel lucky to have friends who are as obsessive as I am with finding answers to the most non-critical questions. Friends who are so eager to reach a solution, they send me WhatsApp messages because I haven't replied on Slack for 45 seconds. yes @liadmord  I'm talking about you",
"stubborn":"I love how with @MatalonMor we can solve a CTF challenge in 2.5 minutes but then spend another 3 hours on understanding to the bit level why the integer overflow was triggered in the first place. Aaaaahhhh satisfaction",
"good reviews":"What @OfriZiv's comments on my blog-post drafts look like: - 'This adds no new information' - 'This should come earlier' - 'This should come later' - 'I don't understand this drawing' - 'Not interesting, delete this paragraph' - 'This doesn't belong here' ... - 'REALLY NICE!!!'",

"CLI game":"I wanted a small CLI game to practice my hex-skills, so I wrote one during my flight to Tel Aviv. I tried it out a bit and I'm pretty happy with the result :) Source code is here - https://github.com/ophirharpaz/Hexdec Next step - write it in C?",
"Golang":"Twitter produces fun and spontaneous tech collaborations",
"Rust":"This tweet came just in time and put a big, big smile on my face. Python, Golang, Rust, Kotlin, what's next?",
"Kotlin":"My dear boyfriend @IddoYadlin had an idea that we both develop HexDec for #Android. Well, he ended up doing this by himself, asking me for only graphics... So I guess HexDec now has implementations in 4 languages and an actual GUI. Sweeeeet. Link to source is in the thread.",
