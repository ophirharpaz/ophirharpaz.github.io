      <title>How Does SSH Port Forwarding Work?</title>

      <description>I often use the command ssh server_addr -L localport:remoteaddr:remoteport to create an SSH tunnel. This allows me, for example, to communicate with a host that is only accessible to the SSH server. You can read more about SSH port forwarding (also known as &amp;ldquo;tunneling&amp;rdquo;) here. This blog post assumes this knowledge.
But what happens behind the scenes when the above-mentioned command is executed? What happens in the SSH client and server when they respond to this port forwarding instruction?</description>

      <description>This is a story about problem solving. True, it involves Python and database code, but eventually what I&amp;rsquo;m describing is running into a problem, understanding its root cause and finding a creative way to solve it.
To understand this blog post, all you need to know is some SQL. I&amp;rsquo;ll try to take care of the rest.
Entities &amp;amp; Schema For the sake of simplicity, we&amp;rsquo;ll be talking about Books and Authors.</description>

      <description>It was two months ago when BlueHat IL’s org-team approached me. At first, I thought they called to ask me to submit a talk. BlueHat IL is one of my favorite information security conferences, so you can imagine I was extremely flattered when I realized they wanted me to review others’ submissions.
The review process took place in the busiest month possible. I spoke together with Daniel in various conferences (Hackfest, DeepSec and Botconf) and taught a threat hunting workshop in my community, Baot.</description>

      <description>It was a couple of days ago at work. I pressed the keyboard shortcut Winkey+R to open Windows&amp;rsquo; Run dialog-box and started typing a file-system path to open. While doing so, the application suggested a couple of paths for me to choose from.
Among these paths, I noticed, was a path to a folder I had previously deleted.
 Why is Run suggesting a non-existing path? and how can I remove this path from the drop-down list?</description>
