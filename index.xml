      <description>This blog post is the result of me scrolling through my Twitter feed from the past year. I’m linking to way too many tweets, so just click on the ones you’re curious about. The topics I’ll touch revolve around impostor syndrome, frustration, motivation and community. I hope you find value in going through my happy and tough moments of 2020.
Impostor Syndrome &amp;amp; Frustration 2019 ended up with me having another instance of impostor syndrome.</description>

      <description>Intro As part of my effort to get better acquainted with cryptography, I&amp;rsquo;ve started reading &amp;ldquo;The Mathematics of Secrets&amp;rdquo;, a book by Joshua Holden which aims to explain the mathematical concepts behind cryptography of both ancient and modern times.
In its second chapter (page 31), Holden poses a challenge to the reader - deciphering a message:

      <description>One thing that&amp;rsquo;s given me headaches for too long was switching between my two Github accounts - work and personal - on the same computer. Today I decided to put an end to it, and it was as simple as ABC. Seriously, look.
A - SSH Keys Generation I&amp;rsquo;m sure most people who are acquainted with git are familiar with this procedure. So I&amp;rsquo;ll simply link to very good instructions and leave you to it.</description>

      <description>Sometimes you succeed in solving a problem but you don&amp;rsquo;t truly understand why it worked. This is what happened to Mor and me when we solved PicoCTF-2019 challenge called flag_shop.
In this challenge, you are a visitor in a flag shop. You can purchase the flag for a certain number of coins, then print it and win. The problem is, the winning flag costs 100,000 coins, and we only have 1,100.</description>

      <title>How Does SSH Port Forwarding Work?</title>
      <link>https://ophirharpaz.github.io/posts/how-does-ssh-port-forwarding-work/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 09 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <guid>https://ophirharpaz.github.io/posts/how-does-ssh-port-forwarding-work/</guid>
      <description>I often use the command ssh server_addr -L localport:remoteaddr:remoteport to create an SSH tunnel. This allows me, for example, to communicate with a host that is only accessible to the SSH server. You can read more about SSH port forwarding (also known as &amp;ldquo;tunneling&amp;rdquo;) here. This blog post assumes this knowledge.
But what happens behind the scenes when the above-mentioned command is executed? What happens in the SSH client and server when they respond to this port forwarding instruction?</description>

      <description>This is a story about problem solving. True, it involves Python and database code, but eventually what I&amp;rsquo;m describing is running into a problem, understanding its root cause and finding a creative way to solve it.
To understand this blog post, all you need to know is some SQL. I&amp;rsquo;ll try to take care of the rest.
Entities &amp;amp; Schema For the sake of simplicity, we&amp;rsquo;ll be talking about Books and Authors.</description>

      <description>It was two months ago when BlueHat IL’s org-team approached me. At first, I thought they called to ask me to submit a talk. BlueHat IL is one of my favorite information security conferences, so you can imagine I was extremely flattered when I realized they wanted me to review others’ submissions.
The review process took place in the busiest month possible. I spoke together with Daniel in various conferences (Hackfest, DeepSec and Botconf) and taught a threat hunting workshop in my community, Baot.</description>

      <description>It was a couple of days ago at work. I pressed the keyboard shortcut Winkey+R to open Windows&amp;rsquo; Run dialog-box and started typing a file-system path to open. While doing so, the application suggested a couple of paths for me to choose from.
Among these paths, I noticed, was a path to a folder I had previously deleted.
 Why is Run suggesting a non-existing path? and how can I remove this path from the drop-down list?</description>
